# A full example of using deeplenstronomy.
# The science goal here will be the detection of galaxy-galaxy lensing and lensed quasars.
# This file will contain all the information needed to describe the dataset.

## We start at the top level with the DATASET section

DATASET:
    NAME: ExampleDataset # set a name, this value is only used if you request the h5 file format
    PARAMETERS:
        SIZE: 1000 # number of images in the full dataset, I'll keep it small for this example
        OUTDIR: ExampleDataset # will be created on your system if your request to save images

## Next we'll specify the COSMOLOGY to use, I'll keep it simple a just use basic values

COSMOLOGY:
    PARAMETERS:
        H0: 74.0
        Om0: 0.3

## Next we technically need the IMAGE and SURVEY sections, but I will get around this using a built-in survey mode
## by specifying survey='des' in deeplenstronomy.make_dataset(), these sections will be automatically written

## Moving on, next up is the SPECIES section
## I'll define a two lens galaxies, a source galaxy, and a quasar
