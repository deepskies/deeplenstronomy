    "\n",
    "The purpose of `deeplenstronomy` is to provide the functionality for users to generate entire datasets using a single input file. The use of this framework separates the programmer from the astronomer when creating datasets, and will hopefully enable the creation of easily-reproducible datasets across the field."

    "## The Backbone of `deeplenstronomy`\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `deeplenstronomy`, the vast majority of your time will be spent construcitng the \"**configuration file**\" that will tell `deeplenstronomy` how to make your dataset. This configuration file is a `yaml` file where you will set the attributes of different objects in your dataset. As an example, you define the properties of the camera used to collect the images with a section like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "IMAGE:\n",
    "    PARAMETERS:\n",
    "        exposure_time: 90\n",
    "        numPix: 100\n",
    "        pixel_scale: 0.263\n",

    "        ccd_gain: 6.083\n",
    "```\n",

    "For a full introduction to the different parts of a `deeplenstronomy` configuration file, please read the [Creating `deeplenstronomy` Configuration Files](https://github.com/deepskies/deeplenstronomy/blob/master/Notebooks/ConfigFiles.md) documentation."
